      <p className="recipe-text">Back to school brings a plethora of emotions for the kids heading into another year: excitement, nerves, and some sadness that summer has ended. However, I mainly feel pressure to keep it all together. Filling out paperwork, buying school supplies, and preparing for busy evenings filled with homework and extracurriculars.</p>
      
      <p className="recipe-text">One of the most important things I can do for myself and my family is to plan easy, comforting meals. This is not the time to push my family to try wildly different dishes. We are all dealing with enough newness right now. But that doesn’t mean we’ll eat the same old thing every night. I keep it interesting by taking our favorites and making minor changes. I make a slightly different stir fry, buy unique pasta shapes, or add different spices.</p>
      
      <p className="recipe-text">Below are dinners that are all on the table in 30 minutes and will hopefully make everyone’s night a little more enjoyable. Lean into these easy, family favorites to help us as we try to keep it all together.</p>

      <p className="recipe-text">Coating chicken breasts in flour is a genius move. It helps keep the moisture in and forms a crust for added texture. The dish is finished with a buttery lemon pan sauce that will wow everyone at the table.</p>
      <p className="recipe-text">This recipe is perfect for those nights when you need something quick but flavorful. You can pair it with a simple side of steamed vegetables or mashed potatoes to complete the meal. The lemon pepper seasoning adds a zesty kick that kids and adults alike will enjoy, making it a versatile family favorite.</p>

      <h2 className="recipe-section-title">Burger Salad</h2>

      <p className="recipe-image-caption"><em>Image / Coco Morante</em></p>
      <p className="recipe-text">Keep all the parts that make a burger delicious (the patty, toppings, and sauce) and turn it into a dinner salad. Iceberg lettuce adds a nice crunch, but use your favorite lettuce and whatever tomatoes you have on hand. Sit down and enjoy the freshest tasting burger you’ve ever had.</p>
      <p className="recipe-text">This is a great way to lighten up burger night while keeping all the flavors you love. Add some crumbled bacon or avocado for extra richness, and don’t skimp on the dressing—it’s what brings everything together. It’s also a fantastic option for meal prep; just keep the components separate until you’re ready to eat.</p>

      <h2 className="recipe-section-title">Chop Suey</h2>
      <img className="recipe-image" src="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/p4qQ5PiTG3ZKDIEt5Wn7KguU0p4=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Simply-Recipes-Chop-Suey-LEAD-06-34a1a2b71183454480c39c3f9deac92c.jpg" alt="Chop Suey in a Staub Wok" />
      <p className="recipe-image-caption"><em>Image / Frank Tiu</em></p>
      <p className="recipe-text">Grab your wok and make this satisfying Chinese American favorite. Loads of vegetables and chicken thighs are stir fried and coated in a pantry sauce that will have you licking the plate. Serve with rice.</p>
      <p className="recipe-text">Feel free to customize this with whatever veggies you have in the fridge—bell peppers, broccoli, or snap peas work wonderfully. The sauce is the star here, so make sure to taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking. It’s a one-pan wonder that cleans up quickly, leaving you more time for family.</p>

      <h2 className="recipe-section-title">Microwave Red Curry Poached Salmon</h2>
      <img className="recipe-image" src="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/c_CxvSEsdKg5JiGobKpKKMcC0T8=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/-Recipes-Microwave-Coconut-Salmon-LEAD-12-d12ef45380554224a444ff48cee093e3.jpg" alt="Microwave Red Curry Poached Salmon" />
      <p className="recipe-image-caption"><em>Image / Tara Omidvar</em></p>
      <p className="recipe-text">Poaching salmon in an aromatic curry sauce sounds like it will require multiple pans and an oven, but the microwave does all the heavy lifting in this family meal. Serve with jasmine rice and chopped herbs.</p>
      <p className="recipe-text">This dish is a game-changer for busy nights—it’s fast, healthy, and packed with flavor. The curry paste can be adjusted for spice level, making it kid-friendly if needed. Add a squeeze of lime at the end for a burst of freshness that elevates the whole dish.</p>

      <h2 className="recipe-section-title">Skillet Cacio e Pepe Tortellini With Wilted Greens</h2>
      <img className="recipe-image" src="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/GOyKGckn88muqRjnnnZT9nUfU0s=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Simply-Recipes-Skillet-Cacio-e-Pepe-Tortellini-LEAD-2-1a81287e04004a53932c00e05da3df18.jpg" alt="Skillet Cacio e Pepe Tortellini" />
      <p className="recipe-image-caption"><em>Image / Ciara Kehoe</em></p>
      <p className="recipe-text">Make an easy dinner even easier by skipping the pot of boiling water. Frozen tortellini is cooked directly in a skillet with olive oil. Stir in your favorite greens, such as baby spinach or chopped kale, and top with cheese before serving.</p>
      <p className="recipe-text">The beauty of this recipe is its simplicity and adaptability. Use cheese-filled tortellini for extra indulgence, or switch up the greens based on what’s in season. A generous sprinkle of Parmesan or Pecorino Romano makes it irresistible, and it’s ready in a flash.</p>

      <h2 className="recipe-section-title">Easy Beef Bulgogi</h2>
      <img className="recipe-image" src="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/Vv2ctLOkddIknx0enOQbINB7r-o=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Simply-Recipes-Bulgogi-SEO-daf49e25a78d41ccbf66aba56b50520f.jpg" alt="Beef Bulgogi" />
      <p className="recipe-image-caption"><em>Image / Ciara Kehoe</em></p>
      <p className="recipe-text">Salty sweet beef is always a weeknight winner. "Bulgogi, a marinated and grilled beef popular at Korean restaurants, is easy to make at home," according to recipe developer Cecilia Hae-Jin Lee. Look for marbled beef and let the cast iron skillet get super hot for the best results. Serve with banchan and rice.</p>
      <p className="recipe-text">Marinate the beef ahead of time if you can—it only takes 15 minutes to soak up the flavors. If you’re short on time, even a quick toss in the sauce works. Pair it with kimchi or pickled veggies for an authentic touch that balances the richness of the meat.</p>

      <h2 className="recipe-section-title">Creamy Miso Mushroom Pasta</h2>
      <img className="recipe-image" src="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/8ekc1hptmZjV-wJRWxTbaqm0xd8=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Simply-Recipes-Miso-Mushroom-Pasta-LEAD-07-c96aa347526c480194f98c5a86c44ee1.jpg" alt="Creamy Miso Mushroom Pasta" />
      <p className="recipe-image-caption"><em>Image / Hannah Zimmerman</em></p>
      <p className="recipe-text">Add an flavorful twist to pasta with miso. White miso is made from fermented soybeans and adds a touch of umami without overwhelming the pasta and mushrooms. You’ll find it in the refrigerated section, most likely near the tofu in a grocery store.</p>
      <p className="recipe-text">This dish is a cozy hug in a bowl, perfect for chilly evenings. Use any mushrooms you like—cremini, shiitake, or even button mushrooms work well. A splash of cream or a dollop of butter at the end makes it extra luxurious without much effort.</p>

      <h2 className="recipe-section-title">Creamy Chicken Florentine</h2>
      <img className="recipe-image" src="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/xjdjCt_gduKABBKMrO_-iIqNNOc=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Temp-filename_-10-ac24af938a894208adecfebd2353d04b.jpg" alt="Creamy chicken Florentine in skillet" />
      <p className="recipe-image-caption"><em>Image / Sally Vargas</em></p>
      <p className="recipe-text">Quick, easy, and lusciously creamy, this skillet chicken recipe is a fresh way to serve chicken breasts. As an added bonus, spinach is added to the sauce so you don’t have to make a salad if you don’t want to.</p>
      <p className="recipe-text">The creamy sauce is what makes this dish special—don’t be afraid to add a little extra garlic or a pinch of nutmeg for depth. Serve it over pasta or with crusty bread to soak up every last bit. It’s a complete meal that feels fancy but comes together in no time.</p>

      <h2 className="recipe-section-title">Sheet Pan Shrimp and Asparagus</h2>
      <img className="recipe-image" src="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/ZtHkFBvvIC3lbQvlKjsjf91iFmA=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Simply-Recipes-Sheet-Pan-Shrimp-Asparagus-LEAD-3-6fb26c40ebde412895128a7641f99c0f.jpg" alt="Sheet Pan Shrimp and Asparagus" />
      <p className="recipe-image-caption"><em>Image / Nick Evans</em></p>
      <p className="recipe-text">Both shrimp and asparagus cook notoriously fast. The garlic butter sauce spooned over top brings it all together into a mouth-watering family meal. Serve it with pasta or rice.</p>
      <p className="recipe-text">This is the ultimate low-effort, high-reward dinner. Toss everything on a sheet pan, pop it in the oven, and you’re done. Add some cherry tomatoes or lemon slices for extra color and flavor—it’s foolproof and cleanup is a breeze.</p>

      <h2 className="recipe-section-title">BLT Wraps</h2>
      <img className="recipe-image" src="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/CzSFSzBEOsUXb8piRHCTCO-EFKc=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Simply-Recipes-BLT-Wraps-LEAD-02-75aa2ed533104c52bdb7407575cb7bc5.jpg" alt="BLT Wraps on a Plate" />
      <p className="recipe-image-caption"><em>Image / Nick Evans</em></p>
      <p className="recipe-text">Take advantage of warm weather and ripe tomatoes and make easy back to school meals. Leftovers would make tasty lunches, too. Add sliced turkey for a heartier meal.</p>
      <p className="recipe-text">These wraps are all about fresh ingredients—crisp bacon, juicy tomatoes, and crunchy lettuce. Spread some mayo or avocado mash on the tortilla for extra creaminess. They’re portable, customizable, and perfect for a quick dinner or a packed lunch the next day.</p>
